Description

Ideas:
A recreation of Simon Says. There will be 2 different patterns that are used.
A sequence of patterns will be shown to the player. The player needs to play
back those patterns in the same order they appeared. The player will choose
the first pattern with the A button and the second pattern with the B button.
When the player successfully plays back the pattern, the game progresses to the
next level and a sound effect is played. The game gets harder with each level
with longer sequences of patterns and faster playback times. When the user fails,
the game displays which level the user made it to and the player's highest level.
When the user fails, a sound effect is played and the game is restarted from the beginning.
